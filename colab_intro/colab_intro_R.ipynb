To run them here, click the **Connect** button in the upper-right section of the page.  When you encounter a Jupyter cell with an R script, click the black circle with arrow button to run the code. You are encouraged to investigate options and learn further by editing the script; again click the black circle to run the cell.\n",

However, it is possible that your Anaconda release did not automatically include the R kernel for Jupyter.  You can tell whether it is present if the R logo (blue R in front of gray ellipse) is shown at the top-right of the Jupyter page.  If it is missing, then the code cells below will fail upon execution. To install the R kernel within Python, type: **conda install -c r r-irkernel**.  Alternatively, you can make R available to Jupyter from an R console by typing: **install.packages('IRkernel')  ;  IRkernel::installspec()**.
